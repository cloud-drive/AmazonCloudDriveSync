# AmazonCloudDriveSync

This is to fill in a gap in the Amazon Cloud Drive service 
offering - an app to sync local directory on your computer 
to a folder on CloudDrive.

Please feel free to fork and make pull requests back.  I'd
especially appreciate someone throwing together a windows 
form to help handle configuration instead of the config file

Right now this desktop app is using one of my other projects
oauthX to handle the web based oauth handshake - there may be
better ways to do this, I'm certainly open to it!

Thanks and enjoy!
